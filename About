ABOUT Stop Violence Ecosystem (SVE)

The token's main idea is to incentivize individuals, organizations, and governments to take proactive measures to prevent 
and stop violent behaviors by offering them financial rewards to promote non-violent behavior, or reward individuals who
report cases of violence or intervene in violent situations. Ultimately, the goal of the SVE tokens is to create a 
self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes positive social behavior and reduces violence worldwide.
